    "\n",
    "To access the TANGO graphical user interface (GUI), you have two options (make sure you are in the environment where **cryocat** is installed):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the `/cryocat/app/` folder and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python app.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Alternatively, simply type the following in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   tango_app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note:** If you installed **cryocat** in editable mode (recommended) *before* `tango_app` was added, you will need to reinstall it to have the `tango_app` command properly registered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Neither of these commands will open the GUI directly. Instead, they will start a local server and display an address in the terminal, such as:\n",
