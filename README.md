## PIP

Since cryoCAT is being developed on daily basis, it is recommended to clone the github repository and install it with pip:

```
pip install -e /path/to/your/local/copy/of/cryocat/.
```

* Note that the '-e' will install editable version of the package - this is important because you do not have to upgrade it every time something is changed. The only thing you have to do is to pull the repo to have the latest version, all changes will be visible without running pip install upgrade.
